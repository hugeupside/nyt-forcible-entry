## Deaths resulting from forcible-entry search warrant raids from 2010 to 2016

[A New York Times investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/18/us/forced-entry-warrant-drug-raid.html) found that suspects, bystanders and law enforcement officers die on a regular basis because of decisions to execute search warrants by breaking into residences without knocking or prior announcement. There is no federal requirement that police agencies report data about these incidents, so there is no way to know precisely how often they occur and under what circumstances. But [The Times collected information about deaths](https://github.com/newsdev/nyt-forcible-entry/blob/master/nyt-forcible-entry-deaths-2010-2016.csv) from SWAT team search warrant raids starting in 2010. Through 2016, the tally was 94 deaths, including 13 officers. 

Cases were identified through news reports, interviews, search engines, federal court dockets and data provided by the American Civil Liberties Union from its 2014 survey of police departments in 20 cities. Details about some cases were confirmed through open records requests and interviews with law enforcement officials.   

Because the list may be incomplete, we invite readers to submit a pull request with additional forcible-entry raids. [Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) should have as much information as is available about the raid including a verifiable source.
